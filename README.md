# Automatic Classification of Atmospherical Fronts

  This project proposes an application that detects and classifies air fronts in an automatic manner, using Convolutional Neural Networks for pattern recognition in images of type "synoptic map", which contain multiple weather parameters. The user can upload a synoptic map  and the application informs him if in this image there is an existing atmospherical front on a chosen smaller territory. If there is any front detected, then the algorithm will also classify it in one of three categories: cold, warm or mixed front.
### Codebase
Our code sources and image resources are in the Codebase folder, in which we have the model for our network, the training algorithm, the utilities for the image preprocessing and the datasets.
### Documentation
The documentation for our rproject is stored in the Documentation folder, which provides a short presentation and teaser of our application and a detailed report on our research.
